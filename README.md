Opinionated frontend monorepo with focus on best practices and painless developer experience:

- Monorepo setup that can be easily extended ðŸ”§
- Spin it up with single command ðŸŒ€
- Blazing fast builds, lints, tests with Turborepo [remote caching](https://turborepo.org/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) âš¡
- TypeScript 100% codebase

## Requirements

- [Node v18+](https://nodejs.org/)

## Running

_Easily set up a local development environment_

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run dev` - Start all apps ðŸš€

Visit one of the monorepo apps [localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100/)

## Features:

- [Turborepo v1](https://turborepo.org/) remote cache build system, with blazingly fast execution of commands (build, lint, test etc.) on your local machine and CI
- [TypeScript v5](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) codebase with [Strict Configuration](https://typescript-eslint.io/docs/linting/configs#strict)
- [NextJs v13](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) apps
- Monorepo implements 3 styling solutions to build custom UI components, with shared theme across all apps.  
  Easily import UI components package into app:
  - [Vanilla CSS package](https://github.com/mkosir/turborepo-boilerplate/tree/main/packages/ui)
  - [Tailwind](https://github.com/mkosir/turborepo-boilerplate/tree/main/packages/ui-tailwind) library built with [Tailwind v3](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [Material UI](https://github.com/mkosir/turborepo-boilerplate/tree/main/packages/ui) library built with [MUI v5](https://mui.com/) and shared theme across all apps and packages
- Unit and integration tests with [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library). Run a single test in any monorepo app/package [instantly](https://github.com/mkosir/turborepo-boilerplate-multiple-ui/raw/main/misc/vscode-jest-runner.gif).
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter
- Git hooks with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)
- Commit messages must meet [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.  
  After staging changes just run `npm run commit` and get instant feedback on your commit message formatting and be prompted for required fields by [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

## Conventions

Convention over configuration should be followed as much as possible as described in [Conventions.md](https://github.com/mkosir/turborepo-boilerplate/blob/main/README_CONVENTIONS.md)

TLDR:

- **Code is organized and grouped by feature.** Place code as close to where it's relevant as possible.
- Strive for data immutability.
- Client global state is discouraged. If truly needed use Zustand (no Redux).
- Use named exports. In case of exceptions [eslint rule](https://github.com/mkosir/turborepo-boilerplate/blob/main/packages/config-eslint/index.js#L78) is disabled (e.g. Next.js pages)

## Monorepo

Monorepo features and conventions:

- Monorepo is being quite highly opinionated in order to achieve best developer experience. It's meant to be used as frontend only monorepo, 100% TypeScript, consistent codebase across whole monorepo with automated tooling in place as ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, conventional commits etc.
- Workspaces:
  - It comes with two workspaces `apps` and `packages`.
  - All configurations (eslint, jest, material ui etc.) in `packages` are always prefixed with "config-" and imported into other workspaces directly from source without building (never transpiled).
  - All other `packages` beside configurations are always being built/transpiled and output to `dist/` folder.
- For consistency all applications in monorepo are built with Next.js, but can be easily replaced with any other React framework/tooling (Vite, Remix etc.)
- Monorepo doesn't implement any high-level architectures (islands, micro-frontends), but is prepared with that in mind, so it can be easily extended (page composition, adding shared state etc.)
